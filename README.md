# Terraform CDK azurerm Provider ~> 2.0

This repo builds and publishes the Terraform azurerm Provider bindings for [cdktf](https://cdk.tf).

Current build targets are:

- npm
- Pypi

## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform azurerm Provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 2.0` with every release. If there scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by generating the [provider constructs manually](https://cdk.tf/imports).

These are the upstream dependencies:

- [Terraform CDK](https://cdk.tf)
- [Terraform azurerm Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm)
- [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped. While the Terraform Engine and the Terraform azurerm Provider are relatively stable, the Terraform CDK is in an early stage. Therefore, it's likely that there will be breaking changes.
